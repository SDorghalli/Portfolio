Built a static website built to showcase my background, technical skills, and experience with AWS services. It includes a breakdown of the AWS tools used for deployment and highlights my cloud and systems knowledge. The website is not
currently up due to the unpaid domain :)

Features
Fully static site using plain HTML and Bulma CSS

Hosted on AWS using:
- S3 for static website hosting
- Route 53 for domain management
- CloudFront as CDN with HTTPS support
- ACM for SSL/TLS encryption
- AWS Shield for DDoS protection
